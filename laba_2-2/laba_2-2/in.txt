I hate — okay, hate is a strong word — I really dislike C++ for a couple very specific reasons.

1: It’s named C++ (aka: It is not the paradoxical “safe, upgraded C” you may think it is). Very pretentious. C++ is often touted as a “safe version of C” with more stuff packed in (i.e. “backwards” compatible). How can you blame someone for drawing that conclusion? Look at the name. Now let’s get one thing straight, right now: C++ is not, nor has it ever been, compatible with any version of ANSI C. C++ was around before C was standardized, originating in the form of “C with classes”. Just another dialect of C in a sea of C dialects. The moment the type system was defined to be strongly typed, nay, the moment C++ became an autonomous language with its own separate standard, they erased any hope of compatibility with C. C and C++ are similar like Java and JavaScript are similar. The thing is, JavaScript doesn’t claim to be Java (nor does it claim to be Lisp). When you write code that “works in both C and C++”, you are writing a polyglot and depriving yourself of the advantages of both languages. C++ is not a “safer” version of C, either. C++ is not even “safe”. A language with Undefined Behavior, by definition, cannot possibly be safe, as any suitably large codebase is virtually guaranteed to invoke UB somewhere and encounter a bug with no obvious origin. Here be dragons, so to speak. So the fact that C++ claims to be safe, and dangles from the C family name as if they are somehow different versions of the same language (i.e. C++ is an “improved” C), annoys me greatly. C++ is neither safe nor compatible with C. And being both would be a paradox, anyway. The two properties are mutually exclusive. You can’t be safe if you must be compatible with an unsafe language, and you can’t be compatible with an unsafe language if you must be safe. Moving on.

2: It’s bloated (aka: Sorry, hon. I’m gonna be a few hours late for dinner). It’s often joked that the solution to any problem in C++ is to add more features to the core language. C is great because it is a small language with a small library. It can be decently implemented in a week. C++ gets seemingly dozens of language features with every draft. And the STL library is utter garbage. The `std::cout << stream;` syntax is the worst abuse of operator overloading I have ever seen. For this reason (core language being bloated), a C++ project can take significantly longer to compile than its C equivalent. It may not seem like much, but that is truly annoying.

3: Other programmers (aka: I share many of Linus Torvalds’ opinions on the language). The “nice” features, while not a bad thing in themselves, are far too easy to misuse, and there are a lot of substandard C++ programmers out there. So settling on C++ for your implementation language pretty much dooms the project to being an unmaintainable mess of spaghetti code and pointless, self-important OO bullshit (kinda like Java). If you decide not to use those features, you end up stripping the language down to the point where you might as well just use C. The fact that you’ll piss off C++ programmers by choosing C is an advantage in itself. C is better than C++. C doesn’t pretend to be a “safe”, “sophisticated” language. C knows what it is. C doesn’t pretend to be another language. C doesn’t try to stop you from being stupid. C is a tool in its purest form. That’s why they say that in C, you shoot yourself in the foot, but in C++, it’s more like blowing your whole leg off with a shotgun. C++ makes promises it can’t keep, and just when you least expect it, your program crashes catastrophically but not before somehow corrupting your entire system, because, who knows, maybe you forgot to check a pointer to see if it’s null. Or, maybe you did check, but in the wrong order. Maybe you overflowed a signed int. Maybe you bit shifted just a little too far. Maybe you got the order of events in a switch statement confused and invoked a rare specimen of UB that exists in C++ but not C (this exists). C will make demons fly out of your nose. C++ will go back in time and kill your parents.

If you learn C++, you better get damned good at it. Like I said, I don’t hate C++. C++ is not a bad language. It’s just that C is a better language for being simple and straightforward. And if you want a language without UB, try Go, C# or Java… or Assembly…
